a few seconds ago
so if there is further change in the reference of array element. that will also can see in the combined or sliced one new array.look ex here
76. 9- The Spread Operator
2:05
a few seconds ago
we can also use a spread operator(...) to combine the array look here. and to copy the same array in another one just use the privious with-
2:06
a few seconds ago
- ... three dot spread argument inside the array.-> [...combined]
77. 10- Iterating an Array
1:00
a few seconds ago
here in foreach loop and callbak function the number is a each element or object inside the corresponding array(numbers here).and each --
1:02
a few seconds ago
-- callback function syntax is same as here show.
1:49
a few seconds ago
the forEach is same as for of loop for iterating an array. only the difference is in the second parameter of callback forEach loop we can --
1:50
a few seconds ago
-- pass the index and can show in result.we can not do it with for of loop but we can do it with for in loop.
78. 11- Joining Arrays
0:28

? indicate the parameter is optional in intellisense and after : it tells what should be the type of the parameter.
2:23
a few seconds ago
join is a method to join the array element and split is a method to split the string into an array.and from this mainly we use to crate url-
2:25
a few seconds ago
- slug(hello-my-name-is)
79. 12- Sorting Arrays
1:07
a few seconds ago
sort and reverse method in array are use when we have the numbers and string in the array.
5:21
a few seconds ago
so to sort the object or referal type inside array we use sort method with callback function, return -1 if a<b, 1 if a>b and 0 if a===b

80. 13- Testing the Elements of an Array
2:22
a few seconds ago
every() and some() are the new methods in ES6 with callback function. every() return true if-
2:24
a few seconds ago
- cirteria is fullfilled for all element in the array. and some return true if any of the one element is fulfilled the criteria.
81. 14- Filtering an Array
0:18
a few seconds ago
look here in intellisense at last thisArg?: []. it means not necessay to pass the argument and if you pass then they can be any type.
2:13
a few seconds ago
filter method in array to filter the array with given criteria with callback functions.
82. 15- Mapping an Array
0:22
a few seconds ago
by map method in javascript we can map the each element in array to something else.
2:04
a few seconds ago
by default the join method use comma to combine the array elements.
3:02
a few seconds ago
we can also map the array elements which are string or number to an object.
5:20
a few seconds ago
by default javascript in arraow function with single line assumes that {} this curly braces as an code bloct and here we parse the number --
5:23
a few seconds ago
-- (element in array) in object using map. so here to recognize the javascript that this block here to make a object we need to roundup it -
5:26
a few seconds ago
- with paranthisis.
6:32
a few seconds ago
both the filtered and map method are crearte new array , they not modified the existing referal array.and both are chainable means we can --
6:34
a few seconds ago
-- call them one after another because they dependent to each other and no where else use in the programe.
83. 16- Reducing an Array
3:05
a few seconds ago
reduce is a method in array with callback function with two parameters. first with callback function and second is initial value of the -
3:08
a few seconds ago
- accumulator(i.e. resultant (can be anything , number string, object or anytthing)).and the currentvalue is refer to the current element --
3:11
a few seconds ago
-- in the array while iterating.

2:16

the rest operator is take the all value arguments and put it in inside the array.
4:31
a few seconds ago
we can not put any parameter after the rest parameter. that's why it's name is rest.
95. 5- Default Parameters
2:05
a few seconds ago
setting the default value is can achieve by the logical OR operator truthy and falsy technic or just passin the default value in the --
2:07
a few seconds ago
-- parameter it self. and the all the parameter after the default parameter value should be also default value in paramer.otherwise the -
2:09
a few seconds ago
- result would be not a number. it's remedy is to pass undefined in the place of the default paramerer value and for rest pass value. but -
2:10
a few seconds ago
- it would look so noisy and ugly.
96. 6- Getters and Setters
5:12
a few seconds ago
get and set keyword is use in javascript to set any method work as getter and setter.and by this we can call these function like a property-
5:14
a few seconds ago
- of an object.
97. 7- Try and Catch
0:57
a few seconds ago
defencieve programming.
2:45
a few seconds ago
trow keyword reffer to an exception.and new Error() is just as an normal object of error.
3:52

here e is an object of the error we are define above.
5:30
a few seconds ago
after throwing line the line not go to after it direct goes to handled exception block.
98. 8- Local vs. Global Scope
0:59
a few seconds ago
let and const based variable and constants are limited to block(of function, if or loop) in which they are defined.
4:12
a few seconds ago
local variable or scope take president over global in comparison of access inside locally.
4:43
a few seconds ago
try always to deal with locally scoped variables.
99. 9- Let vs Var
2:32
a few seconds ago
var is not a block scoped, it is a function scoped indeed.
4:34
a few seconds ago
globally declare var keyword are attached to an global window object which is not a good practice. so try not to use var keyword.if you use-
4:37
a few seconds ago
- third party library then this can cause you in trouble by override there variable attache to window object are replace by youe var may be.
5:17
a few seconds ago
when we define funtion then this function is added to a window object, but this is not a good.
100. 10- The This Keyword
0:30
a few seconds ago
this reference the object that is executing the current function or method.
2:11
a few seconds ago
play method -> here this reference the current function object because method is a part of the current function.And -
2:14
a few seconds ago
- function playvideo() -> creating function globally attached to window object.so-
2:16
a few seconds ago
-here, this keyword refer to a window object. global(window in browser, global in node).
3:49
a few seconds ago
new creates empty object so that's why the constructor function this refer to an empty object created by new keyword.
5:37
a few seconds ago
the callback functoion inside the showTags() method here is attached to an window object not to a video oject show that's why this.title is-
5:40
a few seconds ago
- undefined here.and the anonymous function is a regular function not a function of inside any bounded object.
6:18
a few seconds ago
in second parameter of foreach method we can pass an object and that object is reffer to this key inside the callback function.so callback -
6:21
a few seconds ago
- function is belongs to the second [arameter object.
101. 11- Changing This
1:25
a few seconds ago
to overcome from the reference of the global dependency via this in anonymous function we can also use const self = this. and can use the-
1:27
a few seconds ago
- self here to refer the parent function this reference.
4:26
a few seconds ago
we can set the this argument by call, apply and bind for the given function.difference in call and apply is in apply we have to pass -
4:29
a few seconds ago
- further arguments in array.and bind method is return a function instead of calling the attached function here playVideo(), and refer -
4:32
a few seconds ago
- the new object to this of the showVideo function. after that we have to immideately call the returned function by this bind method.and -
4:35
a few seconds ago
- for this just use () this sign beside the bind function. ot will automatically called the returned one.
5:09
a few seconds ago
we can also use bind just beside the function attached with dot to refer this here.
5:34
a few seconds ago
arrow function are inharits the this value.so this is not rebound inside array function. and it's an easy approach to use this inside -
5:37

- function refer to an global window object.
